            - HTML is the building block for a webpage. It allows you to add images, text, and links to a webpage.
          </p>
          <p>
            - CSS allows the programmer to change the style of the webpage. It allows you to change the "look" of the webpage by changing the colors, fonts, and styles.
          </p>
          <p>
            - View a webpage as an organized set of blocks on a grid. Each block can have blocks within them. Blocks can consist of an image, header, menu,or other items.Each block can therefore be defined to have it's on width, font, or other assigned style class.
          </p>
          <p>
            - Scratchpad.io, CodePen.io and Sublime each have their strengths and weaknesses for text editing. We will use scratchpad for the time being and utilize CodePen to share our webpages.

          Repetition
        </div>
        <div class="topic-body"> 
        	<p>
        		Repetition is strongly discouraged for the following reasons:
        	</p>
        	<p>
        		<b>Programming Errors:</b> The more lines of code that is written, the more likely an error will be made by the programmar. Syntax errors are one of the main types of errors and this can be minimized by the use of CSS which will be discussed below.
        	</p>
        	<p>
        		<b>Visual Consistency:</b> When creating a webpage, you want it to look appealing and easy to follow. To do this, CSS allows class styles to be formed for <em> boxes</em> that have the same style throughout the webpage. This allows headers, body text, titles and so forth to have a consistent look and feel.
        	</p>
        	<p>
        		<b>Webpage Bandwidth:</b> Webpage bandwidth and size depends on the number of lines of HTML code among other things such as image size. To reduce the amount of lines of code, CSS allows the programmer to write a class style and refer to that repeatedly instead of writing repetitive lines of code.

        <div class="topic-body">
        	<p>
        		CSS is an acronym for Cascading Style Sheets. It allows programmers to change the style and <em>"feel"</em> of related HTML elements. Similar HTML elements are given the same <em>"class"</em> name. Each class has it's own defined style where the programmar can select the font weight, font style, as well as other items.

          <p>
            Programming languages differ from spoken languages. A spoken language, such as English, can be interpreted many diffferent ways. A programming language has to maintain consistency and be interpreted in only one specific way in order to avoid confusion and give direct instructions to the computer. A programming language also reduces the amount of verbiage required when creating code. An example of a programming language is Python.

            Python is a very widely used programming language. It will be taught in this nanodegree and serve as a foundation for future programming techniques. Python code is written by an individual and it is then compiled and executed to show the result.

            The format for Python arithmetic expressions is as follows:
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>addition</b>: "Number" + "Number"

          </p>
          <p>
            The format for Python variable expressions is as follows:

          <p>
            <b>"2" + "2":</b> The <b>"2"</b> in quotations means that it is a string. This code will <b>Concatenate</b> the two strings together and return <b>"22"</b>.

        <div class="topic-body">
          <p>
            To <b>make</b> a function you need to start you code with the word <b>def</b> followed by a function name and parameters. These parameters will be replaced by another value when the function is used. The body of the function includes the instructions for how to process the parameters and what to return.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Example:</b> def function_Name(parameters)
          </p>
          <p>
            To <b>use</b> the function, you write the name of the function and include your parameter(s) in the parentheses.
          </p>

          <p>
            Functions call be called over and over again by the programmer throughtout the program. This reduces the amount of code a programmer needs to write and it minimizes the risk of making syntax errors while writing the program.

            If a function does not have a return statement, the function is essentially not producing an output that can be used outside of the function itself. If the function is called, the output would be <b>None</b>.

          What is it used for?
        </div>
        <div class="topic-body">
          <p>
            Object oriented programming allows for the creation of objects which are also known as "Classes". Classes allow a programmer to create a set of functions and define certain variables and store it in a class. This class can then be called as an "Instance" in another program or function and it will have access to all of the functions and variables that was stored in the class. A class also adds a layer of protection from other parts of the program. Since data is defined inside a class, the code inside that class will not be able to accidently access other program data. This allows programmers to create "cleaner" looking code and to avoid repetition. OOP also lets the programmer to maintain and modify the existing code by creating new instances or objects with minor changes to the existing one. In addition, OOP provides a defined structure for programs that have abstract datatypes.

          Key OOP Vocabulary
        </div>
        <div class="topic-body">
          <p>
            Class - It is considered a "blueprint" for how to perform something.
          </p>
          <p>
            Object or Instance - Classes are used to create objects or instances. For example: brad = class Name(), brad would be considered the object or instance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Method - A method can also be considered a function. It provides a set of data or generally performs scripting tasks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Module - A python file that includes functions and classes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Library - A library contains a group of programs or modules that perform specific tasks. For example, the Python standard library includes modules such as len(), abs(), and open().
          </p>
          <p>
            Class Variables - These are variables that are defined within a class. They are usable only within the class. Outside the class, the variable is considered undefined.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inheritance - Inheritance allows one class to use another class' data or properties. An example is: brad = class Name(Age). The class name "inherits" the class properties from class Age.
          </p>
          <p>
            Method Overriding - When a class inherits properties/data/functions from another class it can be overridden by method overriding. If a function is defined in both class', the class that is not inherited has priority when the class is called.
          </p>
          <p>
            Abstraction - OOP allows a programmer to extract items from something in order to keep the most relevant data. The purpose of this is to keep things simple and efficient. An example is found with OOP and HTML along with CSS. OOP allows for the creation of classes which is useful in HTML because HTML often times involves the repetition of code. An example is the text in the body of HTML. CSS also involves the creation of classes. An example is the class "topic" which provides instructions on how to format the header of a topic.
